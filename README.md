# Chess

This is a simple chess game simulator program. 

***

It provides a simple terminal interface where figures as labeled as follows:
* K for King
* Q for Queen 
* B for Bishop
* N for Knight
* R for Rook
* P for Pawn

For each move you will be required to specify the field with the chosen figure. Format for this should be "_letter_ _number_". Examples: _A1_, _G5_. Next, specify the field to which you want this figure to move.

TODO:
* Add castling
* Add moving twice for pawns first moves
* Improve this README :)
